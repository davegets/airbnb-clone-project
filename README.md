üìä Database Design

The database for the Airbnb Clone Project is designed as a relational schema with the following key entities:

1. Users

Represents people who use the platform as either hosts or guests.

Fields:

id (Primary Key)

name

email (unique)

password_hash

role (e.g., host, guest, admin)

Relationships:

A user can list multiple properties.

A user can make multiple bookings.

A user can write multiple reviews.

A user is associated with payments they make or receive.

2. Properties

Represents the listings created by hosts.

Fields:

id (Primary Key)

user_id (Foreign Key ‚Üí Users)

title

description

price_per_night

Relationships:

A property belongs to a host (user).

A property can have many bookings.

A property can have many reviews.

3. Bookings

Represents reservations made by guests.

Fields:

id (Primary Key)

user_id (Foreign Key ‚Üí Users)

property_id (Foreign Key ‚Üí Properties)

check_in_date

check_out_date

Relationships:

A booking belongs to a guest (user).

A booking belongs to a property.

A booking is linked to a payment.

4. Reviews

Represents feedback from guests about a property.

Fields:

## ‚ú® Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone Project includes the following core features, each designed to replicate real-world booking platform functionality:

### **1. User Management**
This feature allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. It supports different roles such as guests and hosts, ensuring secure authentication and role-based access throughout the platform.

### **2. Property Management**
Hosts can create, update, and manage property listings with details such as title, description, location, and price per night. This feature ensures a smooth hosting experience by allowing properties to be discoverable by guests.

### **3. Booking System**
Guests can search for available properties and make reservations by selecting check-in and check-out dates. The booking system prevents conflicts by ensuring properties cannot be double-booked.

### **4. Reviews and Ratings**
Guests can leave feedback on properties they have stayed at, providing a rating and comments. This feature helps maintain trust and transparency within the platform, improving decision-making for future guests.

### **5. Payments**
Secure online payments are processed for each booking. This feature ensures transactions between guests and hosts are recorded, with statuses such as pending, completed, or failed.

### **6. API Security**
All interactions with the platform‚Äôs backend are protected using modern security measures like authentication tokens and encrypted data transfer. This safeguards sensitive information such as user credentials and payment details.

### **7. CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
The project integrates CI/CD practices using tools like GitHub Actions and Docker. This feature automates testing, building, and deployment, ensuring the platform remains stable, scalable, and production-ready.


## üîí API Security

Securing the backend APIs of the Airbnb Clone Project is essential to protect user data, maintain trust, and ensure safe transactions. The following key security measures will be implemented:

### **1. Authentication**
Only registered users will be able to access the system through secure login mechanisms (e.g., JWT tokens or session-based authentication).  
**Why it matters:** Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data such as user information, bookings, and payment details.

### **2. Authorization**
Role-based access control will ensure that users can only perform actions allowed for their role (e.g., guests cannot edit properties, only hosts can manage listings).  
**Why it matters:** Protects the integrity of the system by ensuring users only access resources they are permitted to.

### **3. Data Encryption**
All communication between client and server will use HTTPS (TLS/SSL). Sensitive fields like passwords will be hashed and never stored in plain text.  
**Why it matters:** Protects against data breaches and ensures sensitive data such as login credentials and payment details remain secure.

### **4. Rate Limiting**
APIs will include request rate limiting to prevent abuse such as brute-force login attempts or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.  
**Why it matters:** Ensures the platform remains available and responsive even under malicious traffic.

### **5. Input Validation & Sanitization**
All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).  
**Why it matters:** Protects the system from malicious input that could compromise the database or application behavior.

### **6. Secure Payments Handling**
Payment APIs will follow industry standards (e.g., PCI DSS compliance) and sensitive financial data will not be stored directly on the platform.  
**Why it matters:** Ensures safe financial transactions and builds user trust in the platform.

---

By implementing these measures, the Airbnb Clone Project ensures a secure, scalable, and reliable system that protects both hosts and guests while maintaining smooth operations.
