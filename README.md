Technology Stack

1. Django

Purpose: A high-level Python web framework used for rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

In this project: It serves as the backend framework for building APIs, managing authentication, handling business logic, and integrating with the database.

2. MySQL

Purpose: A widely used relational database management system (RDBMS).

In this project: It is the primary database for storing structured data such as users, properties, bookings, and payments.

3. GraphQL

Purpose: A query language and runtime for APIs, providing a more flexible and efficient alternative to REST.

In this project: It allows the frontend to fetch exactly the data it needs from the backend, improving performance and developer productivity.

4. GitHub

Purpose: A platform for version control and collaboration, built on Git.

In this project: Used to host repositories, manage code versions, enable collaboration, and support team workflows.

5. Markdown

Purpose: A lightweight markup language for formatting plain text documents.

In this project: Used for creating structured documentation like the README.md, team roles, and database schemas.

6. Docker

Purpose: A containerization platform that packages applications and dependencies into portable, isolated environments.

In this project: Ensures the application runs consistently across different environments and simplifies deployment.

7. GitHub Actions

Purpose: A CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) tool integrated into GitHub.

In this project: Automates tasks such as running tests, linting code, and deploying the app, making development and deployment more efficient.

8. CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)

Purpose: A set of practices for automating integration, testing, and deployment of applications.

In this project: Ensures smooth pipeline automation, reducing manual errors and speeding up releases.

9. API Security Measures

Purpose: Tools and practices for protecting APIs (authentication, authorization, encryption, etc.).

In this project: Safeguards sensitive user data and secures transactions between clients and the server.
